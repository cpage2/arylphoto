Photography Portfolio site

![ARYL Home Page](/Screenshots/Gallery-lp.png)

# Description
Project is a simple portfolio site for a photographer. A gallery makes up
the home page with a slideshow activated after an image is clicked. The site also includes
an About and Contact page.

All pages include light and dark modes with them starting in dark.
Website is mobile responsive.


# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

# Issues
Currently, the pages do not stay in "Light Mode" once a new page is clicked.
It will revert back to dark, so the user will have to click the "Light Mode" button again.
